My professional experience spans freelance web development, however recently I've been interested in working in large companies, being part of something bigger than myself. I prefer hybrid work and enjoy collaborating with other people.",

I also have a unique interest in quantified self, how we can improve ourselves through data, where I'm growing a app that helps us track our productivity and unproductivity.",

Breath of fresh air to have got such an incredible and advanced SaaS tool made at such a reasonable price.
